# 5G
A collection of sources on 5G and the questions around its biological effects.

Background:
In the current (2019) debate, it is difficult if not impossible to tell between
scientifically reasonable facts and argumentation,
and mere opinion and interest-driven statements.

Aware of the difficulty, this collection aims at clarifying the picture somewhat.
