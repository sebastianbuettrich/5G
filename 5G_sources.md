**The present annual report is the twelfth in this series and covers studies published from October 2015 up to and including March 2017. The report covers different areas of EMF (static, low frequency, intermediate, and radio frequency fields) and different types of studies such as biological, human and epidemiological studies.
No new health risks have been identified. Whether mobile phone use causes brain tumours or not was mainly addressed using time trends studies in the last two years. The results were not entirely consistent but mainly point towards a lack of association. Some cell and animal studies indicate that EMF exposure may cause oxidative stress even at low exposure levels. It is unclear what relevance this may have when it comes to direct health effects in humans. A striking result was that some studies showed a stronger association between memory functions and radio wave exposure than other usage variables.**

Deliverable D17: Report on health effects of RF with recommendations for non-ionising radiation protection and research needs
**On the basis of the epidemiological studies reviewed, because of the inconsistencies of results and
the limitations of these studies, it is not possible to evaluate at this time whether there exists a
health risk from exposure to RF radiation, particularly at the levels of concern for mobile
communication. A number of recent large studies of glioma, acoustic neurinoma and possibly
parotid gland tumours appear to suggest a possible increased risk related to long term or heavy use
of phones. It is unclear, however, whether the observed associations are real, reflecting a causal
association, or artefactual, reflecting differential reporting between cases and controls.**

Planetary electromagnetic pollution: it is time to assess its impact

Published:December, 2018 DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30221-3
**A recent evaluation of 2266 studies (including in-vitro and in-vivo studies in human, animal, and plant experimental systems and population studies) found that most studies (n=1546, 68∙2%) have demonstrated significant biological or health effects associated with exposure to anthropogenic electromagnetic fields. We have published our preliminary data on radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation, which shows that 89% (216 of 242) of experimental studies that investigated oxidative stress endpoints showed significant effects.
This weight of scientific evidence refutes the prominent claim that the deployment of wireless technologies poses no health risks at the currently permitted non-thermal radiofrequency exposure levels.**

**[Citing EU Commision report:] The Reflex project studied how low-energy EMF interacts directly with biological materials in the laboratory (in vitro). The researchers showed that exposing cells to ELF and RF electromagnetic fields could cause DNA to break apart and thus
aff ect how cells develop. The key to this project lies in the standardised equipment that the partners, from all over Europe, used to do their experiments. This meant that several partners could independently confirm the experimental results. While these results do not prove that there are hazards from EMFs, they do indicate promising lines of investigation for further work.**
**Abstract: REFLEX, a project funded by the EU under the 5th Framework Programme (QLK4-CT-1999-01574), was carried out by 12 research groups from 7 European countries1 from the year 2000 to 2004. The goal of the project was to search for biological effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) in in vitro cell systems which may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The data obtained showed that extremely low frequency EMF (ELF-EMF) had genotoxic effects on primary cell cultures of human fibroblasts and on other cell lines. ELF-EMF generated DNA strand breaks at a significant level at a flux density as low as 35 μT. There was a strong positive correlation between both the intensity and duration of exposure and the increase in single and double DNA strand breaks and micronuclei frequencies. Chromosomal aberrations were also observed after ELF-EMF exposure of human fibroblasts. Surprisingly, genotoxic effects were only observed when cells were exposed intermittently to ELF-EMF, but not when exposed continuously. Responsiveness of fibroblasts to ELF-EMF increased with the age of the donor and in the presence of specific genetic repair defects. The effect also differed among the other types of cells examined. In particular, lymphocytes and myelocytes from adult donors were not responsive. With respect to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), data showed that RF-EMF produced genotoxic effects in fibroblasts, HL-60 cells and granulosa cells of rats, but not in human lymphocytes.**

**[From abstract:] the expansion of broadband with shorter wavelength radiofrequency radiation highlights the concern that health and safety issues remain unknown. Controversy continues with regards to harm from current 2G, 3G and 4G wireless technologies. 5G technologies are far less studied for human or environmental effects.
It is argued that the addition of this added high frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, will contribute to a negative public health outcome both from both physical and mental health perspectives.
Radiofrequency radiation (RF) is increasingly being recognized as a new form of environmental pollution. Like other common toxic exposures, the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR) will be problematic if not impossible to sort out epidemiologically as there no longer remains an unexposed control group. This is especially important considering these effects are likely magnified by synergistic toxic exposures and other common health risk behaviors. Effects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated.**

**Highlights:
\- RF-EMF exposure is rising and health effects of are still under investigation.
\- Both oncologic and non-cancerous chronic effects have been suggested.
\- 5G networks could have health effects and will use MMW, still scarcely explored.
\- Adequate knowledge of RF-EMF biological effects is also needed in clinical practice.
\- Underrating the problem could lead to a further rise in noncommunicable diseases.**

Millimeter waves or extremely high frequency electromagnetic fields in the environment: what are their effects on bacteria?
Soghomonyan, D., Trchounian, K. & Trchounian, A. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100: 4761. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7538-0
**Millimeter waves (MMW) or electromagnetic fields of extremely high frequencies at low intensity is a new environmental factor, the level of which is increased as technology advance. It is of interest that bacteria and other cells might communicate with each other by electromagnetic field of sub-extremely high frequency range. These MMW affected Escherichia coli and many other bacteria, mainly depressing their growth and changing properties and activity. These effects were non-thermal and depended on different factors. The significant cellular targets for MMW effects could be water, cell plasma membrane, and genome. The model for the MMW interaction with bacteria is suggested; a role of the membrane-associated proton FOF1-ATPase, key enzyme of bioenergetic relevance, is proposed. The consequences of MMW interaction with bacteria are the changes in their sensitivity to different biologically active chemicals, including antibiotics. Novel data on MMW effects on bacteria and their sensitivity to different antibiotics are presented and discussed; the combined action of MMW and antibiotics resulted with more strong effects. These effects are of significance for understanding changed metabolic pathways and distinguish role of bacteria in environment; they might be leading to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The effects might have applications in the development of technique, therapeutic practices, and food protection technology.**

Is there a Biological Basis for Therapeutic Applications of Millimetre Waves and THz Waves?
Mattsson, MO., Zeni, O. & Simkó, M. J Infrared Milli Terahz Waves (2018) 39: 863. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10762-018-0483-5
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10762-018-0483-5
**The aim of the present study is to investigate if published experimental studies (in vivo and in vitro) provide evidence for “non-thermal” biological effects of MMW and THz. Such effects would occur in absence of tissue heating and associated damage and are the ones that can be exploited for therapeutic medical use. The investigated studies provide some evidence for both MMW and THz that can influence biological systems in a manner that is not obviously driven by tissue heating. However, the number of relevant studies is very limited which severely limits the drawing of any far-reaching conclusions.**

**Vestibular schwannomas grow in the region within the brain where most of the energy by radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from using mobile phones is absorbed. The authors used 2 Danish nationwide cohort studies, one a study of all adult Danes subscribing for a mobile phone in 1995 or earlier and one on sociodemographic factors and cancer risk, and followed subjects included in both cohorts for occurrence of vestibular schwannoma up to 2006 inclusively. In this study including 2.9 million subjects, a long-term mobile phone subscription of ≥11 years was not related to an increased vestibular schwannoma risk in men (relative risk estimate = 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.52, 1.46), and no vestibular schwannoma cases among long-term subscribers occurred in women versus 1.6 expected. Vestibular schwannomas did not occur more often on the right side of the head, although the majority of Danes reported holding their mobile phone to the right ear. Vestibular schwannomas in long-term male subscribers were not of larger size than expected. Overall, no evidence was found that mobile phone use is related to the risk of vestibular schwannoma. Because of the usually slow growth of vestibular schwannoma and possible diagnostic delay, further surveillance is indicated.**
