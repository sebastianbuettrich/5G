The following list aims at compiling

scientifically relevant studies/reports/papers on

impact of EMF 
in microwave freuency range (here interpreted broadly as 300 MHz (1 m) and 300 GHz (1 mm)) 
on biological systems (living organisms),
with focus on - but not limited to -
non-thermal, below ICNIRP-limits effects.

Aware of the difficulty of this,
we group the sources into 3 categories:

1. scientific credibility relevant	

2. scientific credibility unclear

3. scientific credibility low/zero

We add 

4. a list of various links, reports, commentaries, keywords 

# 4. Various links, reports, commentaries, keywords
