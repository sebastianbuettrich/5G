The following list aims at compiling

scientifically relevant studies/reports/papers on

impact of EMF 
in microwave freuency range (here interpreted broadly as 300 MHz (1 m) and 300 GHz (1 mm)) 
on biological systems (living organisms),
with focus on - but not limited to -
non-thermal, below ICNIRP-limits effects.

Aware of the difficulty of this,
we group the sources into 3 categories:

1. scientific credibility relevant	

2. scientific credibility unclear

3. scientific credibility low/zero

We add 

4. a list of various links, reports, commentaries, keywords 

# 4. Various links, reports, commentaries, keywords 


ITU
SERIES K: PROTECTION AGAINST INTERFERENCE
The impact of RF-EMF exposure limits stricter than the ICNIRP or IEEE guidelines on 4G and 5G mobile network deployment

https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/ITU-Report-EMF-Limits-on-5G.pdf

**Informative study on exposure limits and impact on deployment - key thesis: "exposure limits below the ICNIRP or IEEE guidelines will further restrict upcoming 5G network deployment"**

**Quality unclear. Does not seem up-to-date or well founded. States to be about 50/60 Hz only.**
