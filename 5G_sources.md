The following list aims at compiling

scientifically relevant studies/reports/papers on

impact of EMF 
in microwave freuency range (here interpreted broadly as 300 MHz (1 m) and 300 GHz (1 mm)) 
on biological systems (living organisms),
with focus on - but not limited to -
non-thermal, non-ionizing, below ICNIRP-limits effects.

Aware of the difficulty of this,
we group the sources into 3 categories:

1. scientific credibility relevant	- peer-reviewed journals, organizations of somewhat recognized weight, ...

2. scientific credibility unclear

3. scientific credibility low/zero

We add 

4. a list of various links, reports, commentaries, keywords

**conclude that there is clear evidence that RF radiation is a human carcinogen, causing glioma and vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). There is some evidence of an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer, and clear evidence that RF radiation is a multi‑site carcinogen. Based on the Preamble to the IARC Monographs, RF radiation should be classified as carcinogenic to humans, Group 1.**
